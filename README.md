# UHC
![alt text](https://apex-misc.s3.amazonaws.com/Images/UHC+Thumbnail.png)
UHC is a gamemode where you and your team are teleported randomly into the map. With all other players. You are given a set time to prepare (usually 10 – 25 minutes) after this time PvP is enabled and the world border starts to slowly shrink forcing you to head to the middle of the map. The aim is to be the last standing player alive. You will not regen health when lost so be careful. Once you die your placed into spectator mode to watch the other player’s journey to victory.
